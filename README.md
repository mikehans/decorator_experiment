# decorator_experiment
Experimentation with decorators in C#.

Original sample from Head First Design Patterns.

Modified to add a Fluent UI. It still has a few issues with excess class instantiation.

Extend to investigate other ways of getting the same thing using Func<T>. It may be possible but may not be a good idea as the set of classes may start to lose cohesion.
